# Snowflake AI-Library Connector

The CNVRG.io Snowflake AI-Library Connector is a Python script that allows you to connect to Snowflake, run queries, and export query results to a CSV file. This script simplifies the process of interacting with Snowflake's AI-Library by providing an easy-to-use command-line interface.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Snowflake AI-Library Connector, ensure that the following requirements are met:

- Python 3.x installed
- Snowflake Connector for Python installed (`pip install snowflake-connector-python`)

## Usage

To use the Snowflake AI-Library Connector, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the `snowflake_connector.py` script to your local machine.

2. Open a command-line or terminal window.

3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

4. Execute the following command to run the script:

```
python snowflake_connector.py --user <snowflake_username> --password <snowflake_password> --account <snowflake_account> --database <snowflake_database> --warehouse <snowflake_warehouse> --schema <snowflake_schema> --query "<snowflake_query>" --output <output_file.csv>

Example
Here's an example command to connect to Snowflake, run a query, and export the results to a CSV file:

python snowflake_connector.py --user john.doe --password my_password --account my_account --database my_database --warehouse my_warehouse --schema my_schema --query "SELECT * FROM my_table" --output output.csv
This command connects to Snowflake using the provided credentials, executes the query (SELECT * FROM my_table), and saves the results in a file named output.csv in the current directory.
```
Replace the following placeholders with your Snowflake connection and query details:

```
<snowflake_username>: Your Snowflake username.
<snowflake_password>: Your Snowflake password.
<snowflake_account>: Your Snowflake account name.
<snowflake_database>: Your Snowflake database name.
<snowflake_warehouse>: Your Snowflake warehouse name.
<snowflake_schema>: Your Snowflake schema name.
<snowflake_query>: Your Snowflake query enclosed in double quotes.
<output_file.csv>: The name of the output CSV file to store the query results.
```
